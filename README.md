Web app provides car rental service which has a customer panel for making booking requests and an admin panel to explore booking requests which can only be accessed by the vendor through admin login authentication. 
Built on HTML/CSS and node express JS. 
Automated by CI/CD workflow to test, build the docker image of an app and then deploy to a development server (such as dockerhub, amazon ecr, etc) from where this app docker image can be pulled by the tester to the local system, cloud platforms, etc.
Then mongo image will be pulled from dockerhub which will serve as the database for this app image pulled earlier and the blueprint will laid on a docker compose file to run both images as separate containers connected to an each other so that the app backend can make queries to the mongo db.
